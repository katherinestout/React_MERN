After a new user creates an account and profile, they have the ability to post their favorite quotes in a feed. 
A user can also like and unlike a quote post. 
Users are also able to connect with other users via browsing all of the other profiles, and they are able to connect with users on Instagram as well as Twitter. Users are able to delete their account, as well as delete any of their quote posts. Users can edit and update their profiles, which include their username, bio, and optional Instagram and Twitter links. User profile (bio, usersname, name, optional social media networks: Instagram and Twitter, and all of their quote posts) can be accessed by anyone on CleverCap. CleverCap uses the full MERN stack, as well as CRUD methods.

Although the foundation was built with the course, I have made the project "CleverCap" my own creation with added features, different functionality, different design, and different concepts.
