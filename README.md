To get started, users can create their profile.

Users can continually update their profile. Users are required to have a bio and username. They can additionally add their Instagram and Twitter links.

Once a user has created their profile they can then make, like, and browse quotes in the quotes feed.

This project was built with the help of "MERN Stack Front To Back" by Brad Traversy.

Although the foundation was built with the course, I have made the project "CleverCap" my own creation with added features, different functionality, different design, and different concepts.
