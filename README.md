# CleverCap
CleverCap is a social network, designed for Instagram users looking to find the perfect caption for their photos. After a new user creates an account and profile, they have the ability to post their favorite quotes in a feed. A user can also like and unlike a quote post. Users are also able to connect with other users via browsing all of the other profiles, and they are able to connect with users on Instagram as well as Twitter. Users are able to delete their account, as well as delete any of their quote posts. Users can edit and update their profiles, which include their username, bio, and optional Instagram and Twitter links. User profile (bio, usersname, name, optional social media networks: Instagram and Twitter, and all of their quote posts) can be accessed by anyone on CleverCap. CleverCap uses the full MERN stack, as well as CRUD methods.

This project was built with the help of "MERN Stack Front To Back" by Brad Traversy. 
Although the foundation was built with the course, I have made it into my own with added features.
